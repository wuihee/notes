# Liskov Substitution

## Covariance and Contravariance

- **Covariance**: Substituting a type with a more specific type.
- **Contravariance**: Substituting a type with a more general type.
- **Invariant**
- Generic lists are *invariant.*
- Covariance are only safe in input, while contravariance is only safe in output. Because list can support both input and output, it cannot be either.
