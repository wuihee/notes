# Dynamic Programming

- *Dynamic programming* works on problems where we need to break down our original problem into smaller subproblems. We save the solutions to our subproblems so that we do not need to recompute them.
- To use dynamic programming on a problem we need the problem to have *repeated subproblems* and an *optimal substructure*. In other words, we should be able to solve the problem by combining subproblems (optimal substructure) and some of those subproblems are repeated.
