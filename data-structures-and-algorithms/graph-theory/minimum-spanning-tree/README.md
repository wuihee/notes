# Minimum Spanning Tree

- A *tree* is a collection of nodes connected by edges where there is exactly one path between any pair of nodes.
- A *spanning tree* is a tree that connects all the vertices in an undirected graph.
- The *minimum spanning tree* (MST) problem involves finding a spanning tree of minimum total weight in a connected and unweighted undirected graph.
